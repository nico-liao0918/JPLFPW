  <h1>Service Policies</h1>

  <h2>Fixed Price Policy</h2>
  <p>Each service is offered at a flat rate in either PHP or USD. Currency is based on client preference, but conversion is not based on exchange rates — rather on a 10:1 ratio (₱4,000 = $400).</p>

  <h2>No Return Policy</h2>
  <p>Once a final output is marked “Final” by the client, no further edits or revisions will be accepted. Further changes may be made under the Flexi package (hourly billing).</p>

  <h2>Find Another; Stay Another Policy</h2>
  <p>If a client chooses to use another developer or hosting provider, all assets will be handed over, but I will no longer be responsible for updates, revisions, or maintenance.</p>

  <h2>First In, First Out (FIFO)</h2>
  <p>Project scheduling is handled on a FIFO basis. Rush services are available for projects that need to jump the queue — for an added fee.</p>
